Code Explanation

The NegotiationEngine class is a sophisticated software component designed to simulate the negotiation process between two parties, typically represented as a buyer and a seller, within a predefined framework. This component is integral to applications requiring automated negotiation capabilities, offering a structured approach to dynamic price discussions. Below is an overview of its architecture and functionality:

Initialization and Configuration
Upon instantiation, the NegotiationEngine class initializes with several critical parameters:
•	start_price: The initial offer price that sets the negotiation's starting point.
•	round_limit: A cap on the number of negotiation rounds, preventing endless negotiation cycles and ensuring timely conclusions.
•	convergence_limit: A threshold defining the minimal acceptable relative change between consecutive offers, used to assess the negotiation's progression towards convergence.
These parameters allow for customizable negotiation scenarios, adaptable to varying negotiation contexts and strategies.

Core Functionalities
•	Propose Method: This method enables a party to submit a new offer. It assesses whether the negotiation has exceeded the round_limit, updates the negotiation’s state based on the relative change between the new and previous offers (converging if within the convergence_limit, diverging otherwise), and records the offer in the negotiation history. The method ensures that the negotiation progresses towards a potential agreement or identifies stagnation points.
•	Accept Offer Method: This functionality allows a party to accept the current offer, marking the successful conclusion of the negotiation with an agreement.
•	Terminate Negotiation Method: This method provides the capability to unilaterally terminate the negotiation process, offering an escape mechanism in cases where an agreement seems unattainable.
•	Get Negotiation Status Method: This utility function returns the current state of the negotiation, providing real-time feedback on its progress, which is crucial for monitoring and decision-making.

State Management
The negotiation process's state is dynamically managed and can assume various statuses, including "In Progress", "Converging", "Diverging", "Terminated: Max rounds reached", "Agreement Reached", and "Terminated by User". This state management facilitates the tracking of the negotiation's progression and outcome, enabling responsive and informed decision-making.

Historical Tracking
The offer_history attribute meticulously records each offer made during the negotiation, serving as a valuable audit trail and analytical resource, offering insights into negotiation dynamics and participant behavior.

Use Case Scenario
The provided example usage showcases a typical negotiation sequence:
1.	The negotiation is initialized with a starting price.
2.	The buyer counters with a lower offer.
3.	The seller makes a counteroffer, closer to the initial price.
4.	The buyer accepts the counteroffer, concluding the negotiation successfully.
This NegotiationEngine class exemplifies a pragmatic and efficient approach to automating negotiations, suitable for integration into broader systems requiring such capabilities, such as e-commerce platforms, automated bargaining systems, and virtual marketplaces. Its implementation for a hackathon project would demonstrate not only technical proficiency but also an understanding of complex interaction patterns and decision-making processes in automated environments.
